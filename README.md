# Importing-and-Cleaning-Data

In this project, I determined which match and stadium had the highest attendance during the 2019 FIFA Women's World Cup. Using the R-packages dplyr and tidyr, I imported and manipulated data. After ensuring that the data was "clean", I created a line plot. 

This project allowed me to apply skills from several DataCamp courses, including replacing incorrect data  with correct data, separating columns, and visualizing boxplots and line plots with ggplot2.
